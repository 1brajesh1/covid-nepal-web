        "answer": "The disease can spread from person to person if they breathe in the small droplets containing the virus when that person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.",

Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li><li class='mb-2'>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</li><li class='mb-2'>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li><li class='mb-2'>traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.</li></ul>Why?

        "answer": "<p>No. The Government of Nepal has allocated two hospitals, STIDH(Teku) hospital, and Patan Hospital, where you can get tested for Covid-19 infection. Teku hospital is, however, given the first priority since it specializes in dealing with all kinds of infectious diseases like COVID-19. They work closely with the National Public Health Laboratory which is also situated in Teku that performs the confirmatory testing for COVID-19. Do remember that you do not have to go to Teku hospital to take the swab specimen as other hospitals can take a specimen and send it to NPHL.</p><p>For the treatment of COVID-19, all hospitals can manage beds, ICUs and ventilators for severely infected patients. Since there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease, each case can be managed by all the hospitals, giving antiviral and antibacterial therapy.</p>",

        "answer": "Swab testing is done in Nepal. In some cases, the samples of the positive cases are transported to a WHO reference lab in the region for re-confirmation. The doctors are, however, immediately notified when a case shows a positive result. The specimens as they are highly contagious are transported using the Viral Transport Medium (VTM). In simple words, it as a tube with rubber seals and has chemicals inside it to prevent the specimen from disintegrating. It is generally Tripple packed in virus transport package. If the sample can be taken to the laboratory within four days, they may be kept at +4 °C and frozen at -70 °C on arrival if they are to be stored. Otherwise, they should be frozen at or below -70 °C until they can be transported to the laboratory via air shipping.",

Since it is a new and different virus, it requires a different type of vaccine. Research is being done to develop the vaccine against the coronavirus, but has not yet been discovered.
